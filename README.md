This repo contains example platform drivers for the [Silicon Labs EFR32 Mighty Gecko][efr32mg].

[efr32mg]: https://www.silabs.com/support/getting-started/mesh-networking/thread/mighty-gecko

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support KNX over OpenThread.

The platform drivers are used by the [`ot-lightswitch`](samples/ot-lightswitch/) sample apps.

To learn more about building and running the sample apps, refer to:
